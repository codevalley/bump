## Problems and Learnings

### Design Evolution
1. **Initial Queue Implementation**:
   - Using HashMap with RwLock for thread safety
   - Polling-based matching strategy (every 50ms)
   - Limitations:
     - Inefficient active polling
     - No real-time notification system
     - Not easily extensible for different storage backends

2. **Implemented Queue Redesign**:
   - ✅ Created an abstract Queue trait for send/receive operations
   - ✅ Implemented using Arc<RwLock<HashMap>> for shared state
   - ✅ Added configurable matching algorithm with score-based approach
   - ✅ Improved thread safety with proper clone semantics

### Technical Decisions
1. **Choice of Web Framework**: Actix-web
   - Pros: High performance, async support, mature ecosystem
   - Cons: Slightly more complex than alternatives like Rocket
   - Decision: Performance is a key requirement, making Actix-web the better choice

2. **In-Memory Storage & Concurrency**:
   - Implemented using HashMap with parking_lot::RwLock
   - Chose parking_lot over std::sync for better performance
   - Optimized lock patterns to minimize contention
   - Added efficient cleanup mechanism for expired requests

3. **Matching Algorithm Design**:
   - ✅ Implemented weighted scoring system with configurable weights
   - ✅ Used Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
   - ✅ Added early filtering to reduce computation load
   - ✅ Enhanced custom key matching with score boosting
   - ✅ Created different matching thresholds based on presence of custom keys

### Queue Design Considerations
1. **Interface Requirements**:
   - Async-first design
   - Support for timeout-based operations
   - Efficient matching criteria evaluation
   - Clear ownership and lifecycle management

2. **Implementation Options**:
   - tokio::sync::broadcast for notifications
   - Custom channel implementation for complex matching
   - Potential for distributed queue support

### Anticipated Challenges
1. **Concurrency Handling**
   - Need careful design of the request pool to handle concurrent access
   - Must ensure thread safety without sacrificing performance

2. **Timeout Management**
   - Efficient cleanup of timed-out requests
   - Balancing between memory usage and performance

3. **Location Matching**
   - Efficient spatial indexing for location-based matching
   - Handling edge cases in location accuracy
